# Project Documentation

This folder contains the detailed **technical and product documentation** for the
Deep Learning Text-to-Speech Web Application.

The documentation is intentionally separated from the main README to:
- keep the repository clean and readable,
- provide **professional-grade architecture documentation**,
- make design decisions explicit and defensible.
